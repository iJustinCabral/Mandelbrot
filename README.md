## Mandelbrot Set Visulization

As my journey with learning Odin and using raylib continues, I decided I want to create a fun visualization of one of the more interesting mathematical sets known as *The Mandelbort set*.

The Mandelbrot set is a two-dimensional set with a realtively simple definition that exhibits great complexity, especially as it's magnified. Knowing this, I thought what better way to continue my knowledge exploration of raylib than to draw the sets! 

Seeing as its one the best examples of not only the beauty of mathematics but in its simplicity, this serves as another exciting brick to be layed for my learning foundation.
